# Python Keylogger

A simple and powerful Python keylogger that is able to log keystrokes and mouse clicks. It also can take screenshots as well, sending the logs to your email.

Big thanks to _Black Hat Python_ by Seitz and Arnold that helped me understand how malware works by developing it!

### Installation
Run it:
`python PyLoggy.py`
